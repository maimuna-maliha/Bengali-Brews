A Coffee Shop Management System

# Introducing Bengali Brews — A Coffee Shop Management System

I’m super excited to share my latest project — Bengali Brews ☕✨

As a student passionate about tech and real-world problem-solving, I wanted to explore how technology can transform everyday businesses. Coffee shops are one of my favorite places, so I thought — why not build a system to make running one easier and smarter?
That’s how Bengali Brews was brewed — a complete web-based café management system built with PHP + MySQL, designed to help cafés manage their operations digitally and efficiently.

# What is Bengali Brews?
It’s a Coffee Shop Management System that handles everything from menu items to customer feedback. Whether you’re a small café or a growing coffee chain, Bengali Brews simplifies your daily tasks and keeps everything organized in one place.

# ⚙️ Key Features:
📋 Menu management (add, edit, delete items)
🛒 Order processing with automatic totals
💳 Payment tracking (methods + status)
👩‍🍳 Employee management (roles + access control)
📅 Reservation system for customers
🗣 Feedback collection (ratings + comments)
🔐 Role-based login (Admin, Cashier, Barista, Receptionist, etc.)

This project was a great way to apply my database and web development skills while building something that reflects real-world café operations.
For now, Bengali Brews is a prototype project, but I’d love to polish it further — maybe even turn it into a real SaaS tool for small food & beverage businesses someday!
